This is my literate Emacs config!

* Basic Options

This section helps make Emacs more minimal. It's just me disabling things I don't want to see.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t) ;; This line disables the startup message
  (tool-bar-mode -1) ;; this line will disable the toolbar
  (menu-bar-mode -1) ;; this line will disable the menu bar
  (toggle-scroll-bar -1) ;; this line will disable the scroll bar
#+end_src

* Packages

This section contains the packages I use (and some I probably don't).

** Catppuccin Theme
I use this theme everywhere. I tend to use the Mocha variant, but I wonder what Latte looks like...
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes")
  (load-theme 'catppuccin t)

  (setq catppuccin-flavor 'latte)
  (catppuccin-reload)
#+end_src

** Web Development
The packages I will use for front-end stuff (and eventually PHP) will go here.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp

#+end_src
